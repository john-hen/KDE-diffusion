Kernel density estimation via diffusion in 1d and 2d.

Provides the fast, adaptive kernel density estimator based on linear
diffusion processes for one-dimensional and two-dimensional input data
as outlined in the [2010 paper by Botev et al.][paper] The reference
implementation for [1d][kde1d] and [2d][kde2d], in Matlab, was provided
by the paper's first author, Zdravko Botev. This is a re-implementation
in Python, with added test coverage.
