    """
    Estimates the 2d density from discrete observations.

    The input is two lists/arrays `x` and `y` of numbers that represent
    discrete observations of a random variable with two coordinate
    components. The observations are binned on a grid of n×n points.
    `n` will be coerced to the next highest power of two if it isn't
    one to begin with.

    Data `limits` may be specified as a tuple of tuples denoting
    `((xmin, xmax), (ymin, ymax))`. If any of the values are `None`,
    they will be inferred from the data. Each tuple, or even both of
    them, may also be replaced by a single value denoting the upper
    bound of a range centered at zero.

    After binning, the function determines the optimal bandwidth
    according to the diffusion-based method. It then smooths the
    binned data over the grid using a Gaussian kernel with a standard
    deviation corresponding to that bandwidth.

    Returns the estimated `density` and the `grid` (along each of the
    two axes) upon which it was computed, as well as the optimal
    `bandwidth` values (per axis) that the algorithm determined.
    Raises `ValueError` if the algorithm did not converge or `x` and
    `y` are not the same length.
