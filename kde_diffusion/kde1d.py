def kde1d(x, n=1024, limits=None):
    """
    Estimates the 1d density from discrete observations.

    The input is a list/array `x` of numbers that represent discrete
    observations of a random variable. They are binned on a grid of
    `n` points within the data `limits`, if specified, or within
    the limits given by the values' range. `n` will be coerced to the
    next highest power of two if it isn't one to begin with.

    The limits may be given as a tuple (`xmin`, `xmax`) or a single
    number denoting the upper bound of a range centered at zero.
    If any of those values are `None`, they will be inferred from the
    data.

    After binning, the function determines the optimal bandwidth
    according to the diffusion-based method. It then smooths the
    binned data over the grid using a Gaussian kernel with a standard
    deviation corresponding to that bandwidth.

    Returns the estimated `density` and the `grid` upon which it was
    computed, as well as the optimal `bandwidth` value the algorithm
    determined. Raises `ValueError` if the algorithm did not converge.
